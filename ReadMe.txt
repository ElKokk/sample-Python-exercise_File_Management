#Problem

For the "mbox-short.txt" file, write a program that categorizes each mail message by which day of the week the commit was done.
Read through a mail log, build a histogram using a dictionary to count how many messages have come from each email address, and print the dictionary. 
Show total and unique emails for each day.
Add code to the above program to figure out who has the most messages in the file.
